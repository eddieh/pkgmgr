=/usr/local/bin= is at least a default path, but there is a system for
constructing the =PATH= variable on macOS =/usr/libexec/path_helper=
(see =man path_helper= for documentation).

It used to be possible to set =PATH+ in =/etc/launchd.conf=, but that
does not work anymore.

Now there's a few more steps. One must create an =environment.plist=
in either =/Library/LaunchAgents= or =$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents= that
then runs =sh= and calls =launchctl setenv=. Then =launchctl load
$LOC/environtment.plist=.
