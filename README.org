** About

This package manager does what you want. pkgmgr isn't afraid to
package software. We'll package X Window Server, TeX Live, macFUSE,
any free, non-free, open-source, or closed-source software regardless
of license.

We use standard time-tested nomenclature. Packages are called
packages. The package repository is called the package repository.
Binaries are binaries and source code is source code.

** Dependencies

Any UNIX base installation should be able to bootstrap pkgmgr. For the
most part pkgmgr is implemented with gmake (GNU Make) and sh (the
POSIX shell or a Bourne compatible shell).

** Modes

pkgmgr works in two modes: system mode and project mode. System mode
manages packages for your operating system. Project mode manages
packages for a project.
